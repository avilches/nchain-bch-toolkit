/**
 * A ScriptStateListener can be passed during script execution to allow visibility into the internal state of the script at each stage of execution.
 *
 * Note that the stacks are set as local variables in the setup stage as unModifiable lists.  However they are backed by the live list in the
 * script engine and as such will update on each call to the listener.  Also important to note that although the lists themselves cannot
 * be modified the elements are byte arrays and as such could be modified.  Here be dragons!
 *
 * This class is not recommended for real world use.  Only for testing and debugging scripts.
 *
 * See the tools project for an example implementation InteractiveScriptStateListener
